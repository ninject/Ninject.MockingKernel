1. Run build-release.cmd

If you are trying to build for a particular platform, please download and install the respective SDKs:
    WP7: you need the Windows Phone Developer tools (http://create.msdn.com/en-us/home/getting_started).
    .NET Compact Framework 3.5: you need .NET Compact Framework 3.5 Redistributable - http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e3821449-3c6b-42f1-9fd9-0041345b3385
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 2: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8d933343-038f-499c-986c-c3c7e87a60b3
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 3: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1ea49236-0de7-41b1-81c8-a126ff39975b
    Microsoft® Silverlight™ 4: follow directions on this page: http://www.silverlight.net/getstarted

This rest of this file is only needed if you are running the NAnt scripts provided.

If you do not need to run Microsoft® Silverlight™ unit tests, simply pass "-D:skip.silverlightTests=true" in the build command to skip them.

If you would like to run Microsoft® Silverlight™ tests, you need to allow the creation of a local service host and need to follow the steps outlined below.
Before building the first time you have to perform the following steps:
1. Run cmd.exe as Administrator.
2. Enter the following command in the command prompt putting in your own domain and user name:
   netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8887/ user=DOMAIN\user
   or this should do it for you
   netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:8887/ user=%UserDomain%\%UserName%
3. If it worked, you should see "URL reservation successfully added" in the command window.
